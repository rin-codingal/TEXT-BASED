                        Padang food is famous for its use of coconut milk and spicy chili. Minang cuisine consists of three main elements: gulai (curry), lado (chili pepper) and bareh (rice). Among the cooking traditions in Indonesian cuisine, Minangkabau cuisine and most of Sumatran cuisine are influenced by Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine, with dishes cooked in curry sauce with coconut milk and a wide variety of spice mixes.

                        Padang restaurant waiters are known for their exceptional skill of carrying multiple plates in their hands when serving the hidang style.
                        Because most Minangkabau people are Muslims, Minangkabau cuisine follows halal dietary law rigorously. Most of its protein is taken from beef, chicken, water buffalo, goat, lamb, mutton, poultry and fish.

                        Javanese cuisine (Javanese: ꦥꦔꦤ꧀ꦤꦤ꧀ꦗꦮ, romanized: panganan jawa) is the cuisine of Javanese people, a major ethnic group in Indonesia in the provinces of Central Java, Yogyakarta, and East Java.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Javanese cuisine refers exclusively to the cuisine of Javanese people, which is often brought to other regions and countries by Javanese diaspora or foreign descents who have lived in Java.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Javanese cuisine is thought to be sweet, since this is the taste traditionally preferred in Yogyakarta. However, Javanese regions do not only include Yogyakarta.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On the northern and northeastern of Central Java, for instance, the taste tends to be salty and spicy. In East Java, the level of spiciness increases. Today, as Javanese people become more mobile and may move to different regions, this typical stereotype of preferred regional tastes is outdated.

                        Sundanese cuisine (Indonesian: Hidangan Sunda; Sundanese: ᮃᮞᮊᮔ᮪ ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ, romanized: Asakan Sunda) is the cuisine of the Sundanese people of Western Java, and Banten, Indonesia. It is one of the most popular foods in Indonesia. Sundanese food is characterised by its freshness; the famous lalab eaten with sambal and also karedok demonstrate the Sundanese fondness for fresh raw vegetables. Unlike the rich and spicy taste, infused with coconut milk and curry of Minangkabau cuisine, the Sundanese cuisine displays the simple and clear taste; ranged from savoury salty, fresh sourness, mild sweetness, to hot and spicy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sambal terasi is the most important and the most common condiment in Sundanese cuisine, and eaten together with lalab or fried tofu and tempeh.
