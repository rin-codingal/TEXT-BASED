            <b>Beekeeping, or apiculture</b>, is the human management of honey bee colonies. The practice dates back to almos 9,000 years ago, according to a 2015 paper published in the journal Nature.
            Modern beekeepers use human-made bee hives that are typically boxes with rows of wooden frames that bees fill with wax honeycomb. The hives are designed to give beekeepers access to collect honey and help maintain the nest.
