                    <h2>Facts about Cats</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cats (Felis catus) are small, domesticated carnivorous mammals belonging to the family Felidae. 
                        They are the only domesticated species in this family, which also includes lions, tigers, and leopards. 
                        Cats are known for their agility, sharp reflexes, and retractable claws, which make them excellent hunters. 
                        Their keen senses, including night vision and acute hearing, allow them to detect prey and navigate in low-light conditions.
                        Cats have been companions to humans for thousands of years, with domestication tracing back to around 7500 BC in the Near East. 
                        They were revered in ancient cultures, such as Egypt, where they were associated with deities and considered symbols of protection. 
                        Today, cats are popular pets worldwide, valued for their companionship and ability to control vermin.

                        Behaviorally, cats are solitary hunters but can be social animals, forming bonds with humans and other pets. 
                        They communicate through vocalizations like meowing, purring, and hissing, as well as body language.
                        Cats are crepuscular, meaning they are most active during dawn and dusk. 
                        They are also known for their grooming habits, which help maintain their fur and regulate body temperature.
                        Physically, cats have strong, flexible bodies, sharp teeth adapted for meat consumption, and tails that aid in balance. 
                        They exhibit a wide range of coat colors and patterns, depending on their breed. Domestic cats can live up to 15 years or more, with proper care and nutrition.
